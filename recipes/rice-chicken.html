                <p>This Spicy Instant Pot Chicken and Rice is inspired by the chicken burrito bowls from Chipotle! It's quick and easy to make and meal preps for five days!</p>
                <p>The recipe is made in two steps! You prepare the first portion in a pressure cooker, and after it's done cooking, you add some extra ingredients.</p>

        <div class="center">
            <div class="left">
                <ol>
                    <li>(Optional)Marinade your chicken in your marinade of choice. I personally use a lemon garlic marinade.</li>
                    <li>Place your chopped onion in the bottom of your pressure cooker.</li>
                    <li>On top of the onion place your chicken.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle your spices on top of your chicken, followed by the salsa and rice. (Do not stir)</li>
                    <li>Pour in your chicken broth, and pat down the ingredients to make sure everything is covered.</li>
                    <li>Set your pressure cooker to 15-20 minutes depending on the thickness of your chicken</li>
                    <li>While that is cooking prep your corn and beans</li>
                    <li>Once the pressure cooker has finished, remove your chicken, and stir in all addtional ingredients</li>
                    <li>Cut/shred/prep your chicken in your preferred way.(I use 1/2 of a chicken breast per serving)</li>
                    <li>Add chicken and rice mixture to bowl, and save the rest if you are meal prepping.</li>
                    <li>Add any garnish you would like to your bowl,(My girlfriend Margo says sourcream is a must) and enjoy!</li>
