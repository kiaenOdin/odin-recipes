        <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>One of the first things I learn to cook was spaghetti, so I decided that I would use this as one of the recipes for my project!</p>

            <p>It is a pretty normal spaghetti recipe, but please enjoy!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef
                <h5>You gotta season your meat! Here is what I use personally</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tbsp Morton Season all</li>
                    <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp garlic salt</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp garlic powder</li>
                    <li>1 tsp salt</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>12 ounces of spaghetti noodles</li>
            <li>Spaghetti sauce of your choice</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Italian seasoning</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Season your meat.</li>
            <li>Brown your meat, while bringing a large pot of water to a boil</li>
            <li>Once your meat has cooked through, remove your meat from the oven, and strain the grease, return to stove and add pasta sauce, bring to a low simmer.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is coming to a simmer, add your noodles to the pot of water, along with 1/8 cup of italian seasoning.</li>
            <li>Once your noodles are cooked through, strain them, and add butter, mixing it in to stop them from sticking.</li>
            <li>Serve!</li>
