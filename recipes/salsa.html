        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>This is my family's "personal" salsa recipe. Orginally based on Ted's Mexican Resurants recipe.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>5 cans stewed tomatoes(drain cans)</li>
            <li>1 large white onion</li>
            <li>1 bulb of garlic</li>
            <li>2 habaneros</li>
            <li>4 jalepenos</li>
            <li>4 serrano</li>
            <li>1 bunch of cilantro</li>
            <li>2 lemons(juice)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The listed ingredients are a base amount, you may get extra for adjustments.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Separate ingredients into 4 equal portions.</li>
            <li>In a food processor, add ingredients, and chop/blend the ingredients together.</li>
            <li>After each portion, taste test, and determine if you would like to use less or more of any ingredient</li>
            <li>Once you are happy with the taste, add to large bowl, and begin next portion</li>
            <li>When you have mixed all the portions together, taste test one last time, you can add some sugar if it's a bit too spicy, then separate into 5 portions, you can freeze 4, and keep the last to eat(If you know how to can things, salsa is a great thing to can instead of freeze).</li>

        </ol>
