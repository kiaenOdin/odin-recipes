# odin-recipes

This is a lesson/project for The Odin Project(hence refered to as TOP).

TOP is a curriculum for learning full-stack web dev, and this the first project they give you after a rough course on HTML.

By this point in TOP you should be comfortable with the HTML boilerplate, using images, links, lists, header, and paragraphs in HTML.

This is a rough draft that I hope to update as we get into CSS and JS, and later on use as an actual cookbook for recipes we commonly use at my house.
